## Q3. Explain the difference between npm and npx using the create-react-app code example.

- npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript that allow us to install and manage dependencies for your project.

- npx (Node Package Executor) is a package runner that comes bundled with npm. It allow us to execute packages without installing them locally.

* **Create-React-App** is a package that can be used to create a new React app.We can use both npm and npx to create a new React app.

**Using npm**
`npm install create-react-app`
`npx create-react-app my-app`

If we use npm, npm install all the downloads of create-react-app packages and install it locally in our project node-module directory. Then, npx execute the package to create a new React-app.

**Using npx only**
    `npx create-react-app my-app`

Using npx, It downloads the create-react-app package temporarily and execute it to create a new React-app and the package isn't installed locally in our project node_modules directory.

**If we talk about differnces between npm and npx**
1. NPM installs packages locally, while NPX executes packages temporarily without installing them.
2. NPM requires a separate installation step, while NPX combines installation and execution into one step.

If we need to use a package repeatedly, it's better to install it locally. And, if we need to use a package once, NPX is a better option that saves disk space and avoid cluttering in project node modules directory.
